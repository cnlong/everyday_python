　　There is no doubt that happiness is the most precious thing in the world. Without it, life will be empty and meaningless. If you wish to know how to get happiness, you must pay attention to the following two points.
　　First, health is the secret of happiness. Only a strong man can enjoy the pleasure of life.
　　Secondly, happiness consists in contentment. A man who is dissatisfied with his present condition is always in distress.
